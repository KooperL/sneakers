# Important
This app uses python 3.x

# Installation
`pip install virtualenv` to download the module to create/activate a virtual environment.

Create a new venv with `virtualenv flask` and then `source flask/bin/activate` to activate it.

You can then `pip install Flask` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download any other modules.

# Navigation
Enter the app at `app.py`.
Find html files in `templates/`. Note that html files apart from `index.html` are build on top of `base.html` which is used as a header/navbar.<br><br>
Python scripts, used to help build webpages are in the `scripts/` folder. To keep things organised, more subfolders are used along with `__init__.py` files to keep the imports simple and readable.
